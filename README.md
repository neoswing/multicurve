# Framework for calibrating discounting and forward rates' term structure to market

As an immediate impact of the 2007-2009 subprime-mortgage-initiated financial crisis, interest rates linked with distinct credit instruments,
or even distinct tenors of the same instrument commenced to diverge. The new market paradigm was adopted, where the counterparty credit risk
was no longer neglected, and essentially constituted the main body of the instrument spread across interest rate derivatives. In the new market
paradigm, the previously used approach to calculating and discounting future cash flows using a single zero-coupon curve showed its inconsistency.
Instead, the new, market-driven approach implied modelling of different term structure curves for different instruments, exposed to different
levels of credit risk. This repository contains the framework to modelling the multicurve based on the pre-defined set of market credit
instruments with available public market quotes.
